# Getting Started with PySpark

This baseline project shows how to interact with PySpark on Yarn
on Cloudera Data Science Workbench. To begin, open an IPython workbench.

credentials. Click the "Kerberos" tab under your user settings.

Otherwise, you will need to set the HADOOP_USER_NAME environment
variable. Click the "Environment" tab under your project settings.
